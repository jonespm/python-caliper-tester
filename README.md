This is used to test the Python Caliper Sensor for a few events we're interested in.

You'll need to install that first (not part of the requirements since it's not deployed)

I'd probably use the develop branch to get the most up-to-date version.

Tested with Python 2 and Python 3.

```
git clone https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-python
cd caliper-python
git checkout develop
pip install -e .
```
